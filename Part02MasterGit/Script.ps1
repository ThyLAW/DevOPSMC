#So staging still has the change that was part of the last commit that is no longer referenced

#Could also reset by a specific commit ID
git reset <first x characters of commit> --soft

#to also reset staging. Note as I'm not specifying a commit its resetting working to the current commit which i've rolled back already
#--mixed is actually the default, i.e. same as git reset which we did before to reset staging!
git reset --mixed
git status

#Now to also reset working. Again since no commit specified its just setting to match current commit. This should look familiar!
#--hard changes staging and working
git reset --hard

#Now clean

#Could do all in one go
